// Types of binary tree
1) Full Binary Tree -> either has 0 or 2 children
2) Complete Binary Tree -> 1) all levels are completely filled except the last level   2) the last level has all nodes on left as possible
3) Perfect Binary Tree -> all leaf nodes should be at the same level
4) Balanced Binary Tree -> height of the tree should at max be log(n) where n is total number of nodes
5) Degenerate Binary Tree -> Straight line( basically a linked list)

struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;

    Node(int x)
    {
        data=x;
        left=NULL;
        right=NULL;
    }
};
